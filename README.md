# AlzheimerDisease-3DCNN-Classifier
Here is the documentation about the construction and methods used in medical image classification with MRI and 3D convolutional nueral networks. It's important to you'd been prior expirience with neuroscience software as ANTs, SPM12, FREESURFER, FSL or even Nipype among others. As a general view the project has 3 stages: Preprocessing pipeline development, model construction and trainning and interpretability analysis

#*third-partly software*

First off all we need to set up our environment in such way we run different software plataforms to construct our pipelines and to assess our partial results. So this software resources it's going to be a strong and powerfull help during the nexts developing tasks
